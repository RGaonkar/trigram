A fox once saw a crow fly over with a piece of cheese in her beak.  "I want 
that cheese," thought the fox.  When the crow landed upon a branch of a tree, 
the fox sat down beneath the tree and called, "Good day, Mistress Crow! How 
well you are looking! How bright your eyes! How glossy your feathers!"
The crow was pleased.  She loved to be flattered. "I am sure your voice is 
even more beautiful than your feathers," said the fox.  "Won't you sing a song 
for me, O queen of the birds?" The Crow was so pleased she could hardly sit 
still. She lifted her head high, closed her eyes and opened her beak to sing: 
CAW-CAW-C-CAW-W-W!  The cheese fell to the ground, right in front of the fox. 
"Thank you Mistress Crow," he said to the unhappy bird. "In exchange for your 
cheese, I will give you a piece of advise: Never trust a flatterer!"

Once upon a time there was a fox strolling through the woods. He came upon a 
grape orchard.  There he found a bunch of beautiful grapes hanging from a high 
branch. "Boy those sure would be tasty," the fox thought to himself. He backed 
up and took a running start, and jumped. He did not get high enough. He went 
back to his starting spot and tried again. He almost got high enough this time, 
but not quite. He tried and tried, again and again, but just couldn't get high
enough to grab the grapes. Finally, the fox gave up. As he walked away, he 
put his nose in the air and said: "I am sure those grapes are sour."
